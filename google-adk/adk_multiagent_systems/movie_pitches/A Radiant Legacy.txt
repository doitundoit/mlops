Logline: A brilliant Polish scientist defies societal expectations and personal tragedy to unlock the secrets of radioactivity, forever changing the world of science and medicine, even as her groundbreaking discoveries ultimately claim her life.

Three-Act Plot Outline:

Act 1: The Unseen Spark
*   **Setup:** Young Maria Skłodowska, a brilliant and ambitious woman in Russian-occupied Poland, faces severe limitations on her education and career due to her gender and nationality. She dreams of scientific discovery but is forced to work as a governess to support her family and her sister's studies.
*   **Inciting Incident:** Maria moves to Paris, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and enrolls at the Sorbonne. She struggles with poverty and cultural differences but excels academically, catching the attention of fellow scientist Pierre Curie.
*   **Rising Action:** Maria and Pierre form a deep intellectual and emotional bond, leading to their marriage. They begin their groundbreaking research on "Becquerel rays" in a rudimentary, unheated shed, facing skepticism and a lack of resources from the scientific establishment. Their shared passion fuels their relentless, painstaking work to isolate new elements.

Act 2: The Weight of Discovery
*   **Confrontation:** After years of arduous labor, Marie and Pierre successfully discover two new elements: polonium and radium, coining the term "radioactivity." Their findings are met with both awe and disbelief.
*   **Rising Action:** The Curies are jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, bringing them international fame and recognition, but also immense pressure and public scrutiny. Marie becomes the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. However, their triumph is tragically cut short when Pierre is killed in a street accident, leaving Marie devastated and a single mother to two young daughters.
*   **Midpoint/Turning Point:** Despite her profound grief and facing renewed sexism from a male-dominated scientific community, Marie resolves to continue their work alone, determined to honor Pierre's legacy and prove her own capabilities. She becomes the first female professor at the Sorbonne.
*   **Climax:** Marie isolates pure radium and publishes her definitive work, earning her a second, unprecedented Nobel Prize in Chemistry, this time entirely on her own merits. This solidifies her individual legacy as one of the greatest scientists of all time.

Act 3: A Radiant Legacy
*   **Falling Action:** Marie dedicates her life to applying her discoveries for the betterment of humanity, founding the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw. During World War I, she bravely develops and deploys mobile radiography units ("petites Curies") to the front lines, personally operating them to save countless lives, often exposing herself to dangerous levels of radiation.
*   **Resolution:** The long-term effects of radiation exposure begin to take a toll on Marie's health, leading to her eventual death from aplastic anemia. Her sacrifice underscores the profound personal cost of her pioneering work.
*   **New Normal:** Marie Curie is posthumously recognized as a scientific icon, a symbol of perseverance, and an inspiration for women in science. Her remains are interred in the Panthéon in Paris, a testament to her enduring legacy and her revolutionary contributions to physics, chemistry, and medicine, which continue to impact the world.
